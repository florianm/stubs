# R Shiny template app
Imagine there's spatial data somewhere on the interwebs, and you'd want to access,
process and present the spatial data on a map. Processing will depend on user
inputs, and changes to inputs shall be reflected on the map in real time.

This template app aims to serve as a stub for a data-driven, responsive web app
based on R Shiny.
